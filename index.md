## Why Buttons

A simple enough UI element that everyone knows

## What the workshop is not about

(Doesn't mean we wouldn't want to discuss that)

- What's the purpose of buttons in user engagement/interaction
- When should a button be used (and not another UI element, like a plain text link)

## Desired Results

- A Website with all your buttons on it
- A ranking: how often is which button clicked?

## Examples of Buttons

## What will your button do/be for?

### Labels

#### Typical button labels

- OK
- cancel
- buy now
- download
- upload

#### Fictional button labels

- Upload mind to the cloud
- Paint all dogs green
- Turn over the government

(Just an image is also fine!)

#### On-site actions
